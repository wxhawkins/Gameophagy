## Overview

It's a game...about autophagy. Try to catch all of the intracellular cargo in the smallest number of autophagosomes. Why are you trying to degrade *everything*? IDK, man; it's a game made by a grad student without much to do at the start of the pandemic -- don't overthink this.

Huge shout out to Javiera Balut for creating the art for the introduction page and to Emily Grush for creating all other illustrations in the game.

####  Autophagy

Autophagy is a process carried out inside the cells of everything from humans to yeast (no, those aren't baseballs on the intro page). Things like proteins, RNA molecules and mitochondria are trapped in a bubble-like membrane called an autophagosome and later broken down by enzymes. Prior to the autophagosome closing/completing, it is called a phagophore; this is what you are drawing with your mouse in Gameophagy. See the game's "Science" section for more details about autophagy and cell biology more broad
